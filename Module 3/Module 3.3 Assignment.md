# Module 3.3 Assignment

In this section, you learned how to create assignments integrated with an online IDE, allowing students to complete their work in a consistent development environment.

In this assignment, you’ll create an assignment in GitHub Classroom with an IDE integration of your choice (Repl.it or MakeCode):
 - Create a new assignment in your classroom
 - Fill out the basic assignment details if prompted then click “Continue”
 - Add a repository to give students starter code
 - Select the online IDE of your choice. Configure language and run command as needed
 - Enable feedback Pull Requests on all student repositories
 - Click “Create assignment”

Follow the prompts to grant access to the organization you are using for your Classroom. Make sure to grant access to all student repositories, then come back to GitHub Classroom when you’re done.   

When you’ve granted access to the online IDE, you’re all set to share your assignment with your students.
