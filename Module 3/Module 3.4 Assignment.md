# Module 3.4 Assignment

In this lesson you learned how to create assignments with autograding tests, allowing your students to see immediate feedback upon assignment submission. 

In this assignment, you’ll create an assignment in GitHub Classroom with an autograding test by following the instructions below:
 - Create a new assignment in your classroom
 - Fill out the basic assignment details then click “Continue”
 - Add starter code
 - Select the online IDE of your choice (configure language and run command as needed)
 - Add autograding tests
   - Select a grading method from the drop down
   - Provide a test name and run command
   - Click the “Save test case” button
 - Enable feedback Pull Requests on all student repositories
 - Click “Create Assignment”  
 
After you’ve created your assignment, you can share the assignment invitation URL with your students. When students accept the assignment, the autograding tests will run after every push they make to their repository.   

## Submission
To submit this assignment, create an issue titled `Module 3.4 Assignment` in this repository. In the issue, provide the link to the Actions tab on the assignment you created to display your autograding test, then proceed to the next module.
