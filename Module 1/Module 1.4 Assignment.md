# Module 1.4 Assignment

You were introduced to the tool [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) in this lesson. I would like you to replicate this visualization using Visulaizing Git:

![A git visualization showing dots to represent commits. From left to right, there is a commit labeled "first commit", then another commit. From there the commits fork into two directions. There is a line continuing to extend straight to the right with 1 commit that has a branch label that says "new-feature". There is another diagonal line extending from the fork going up and to the right. The diagonal line has 1 commit highlighted in green that has a branch label, "master", as well as a label that says "HEAD".](https://github.com/github-campus-advisors/Campus-Advisor-Training/blob/master/Module%201/assets/visualize_git.png)

Note, there is more than one way to replicate this visualization. 

- [ ] Go to [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)
- [ ] Replicate the image above by determining the correct sequence of git commands
- [ ] Take a screenshot of your work, including the command line, in the visualizer
- [ ] Upload your screenshot to a new Issue titled Module 1.4 Assignment
