# Module 2.3 Assignment

In this lesson, you learned more about how branches are used in the GitHub workflow. To complete this assignment, you’ll use the command line to create a new branch and change this file in your local repository by following the instructions below:

1. Create a new branch named `assignment-edit` in your local repository using the command line
2. Edit this file `Module 2.3 Assignment.md` by using a text editor to add your name on the first line above the title, then save your changes
3. Push your changes to GitHub from the command line (Need help pushing to GitHub? [Watch Module 2.1](https://youtu.be/R2bLo-KiYlU))
4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub after you’ve pushed your changes to compare the two branches, then merge these changes into the `master` branch
5. Delete the `assignment-edit` branch after you’ve successfully merged your branch
