# Welcome to Campus Advisor Training
Welcome to Campus Advisor training. Weâ€™re so happy youâ€™re here!  

In this training, you will be presented with a mix of video lessons and assignments. All videos and assignments can be found in this repository under their respective modules.  

In each module, you will find video lessons marked with this icon ðŸ“º and assignments will be marked with this icon ðŸ““. 

## To begin
Your journey begins in Module 0, where youâ€™ll setup everything you need to complete the training.

## When you are finished
Once you have completed the training, youâ€™re free to end there with your new knowledge. If you want to take it a step further, you might want to become a GitHub Campus Advisor.

GitHub Campus Advisors are a community of educator leaders who champion industry tools in their classroom. As a Campus Advisor, youâ€™ll:
- Join a collaborative network that allows you to learn from your peers, see how theyâ€™re supporting their classrooms, and share your own tips
- Receive professional development support from GitHub
- Be invited to participate in GitHub Education sponsored conferences
 
Educators who have been approved for faculty benefits through the GitHub Teacher Toolbox may apply to become a Campus Advisor.
Once you have completed Modules 1-4, you can find a link to the Campus Advisor application in the [GitHub Teacher Toolbox](https://education.github.com/toolbox/offers). After filling that out, we will review your training materials and follow up with you to schedule a short 15-minute interview.

## This is your training
It is beneficial that you take advantage of the resources presented to you, but if you find instances where things can be improved, please create an issue in the original repository [here](https://github.com/github-campus-advisors/Campus-Advisor-Training/issues). If you are not familiar with issues in GitHub, no worries, you will learn about them soon.

## Questions
If you have any questions regarding setup or on any of the learning modules, head over to the [GitHub Education Community](https://education.github.community/c/teachers/advisors) for assistance.
