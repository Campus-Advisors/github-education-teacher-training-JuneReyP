# Module 5 - Utilizing AWS Cloud9 in the Classroom
In this lesson we are going to take an opportunity to explore AWS Educate and AWS Cloud9.  Becoming an AWS Educate member provides a wide variety of benefits. The one benefit we will explore in this lesson is the ability to use the AWS Cloud9 IDE for free. Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE, a place where you can write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.

In this module you will signup for a free AWS Educate Account and explore how to provide your students access. Afterwards, we will dive into how to use GitHub Classroom alongside AWS Educate to expose your students to the industry tool, AWS Cloud9 IDE.
