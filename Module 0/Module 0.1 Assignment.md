# Assignment 0.1: Getting Started

1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads), install, and [configure](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) git. Windows users please install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
3. If you are new to Git, GitHub, and the command-line, we recommend[downloading ATOM](https://atom.io/), a text editor, which is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. ATOM will be used in all modules.

    #### Mac and Linux Setup
      If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, I would recommend following these instructions to setup the ATOM command-line:

    #### Chromebook User Setup
      If you are using a Chromebook, great news! You can use ATOM to follow along with the videos with some easy instructions:

    #### Windows User Setup
      If you are using Windows, and new to the command-line, I would recommend following additional instructions to avoid using the default shell, known as "PowerShell," in ATOM since all of the examples in the modules will be using a Unix based shell:

4. Make sure to set Git with your name and email address using the following commands on the command-line with your name and email address:
```
$ git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
Git will use this information when you work on a project.
