# Assignment 2: Teacher Toolbox
In order to become a GitHub Campus Advisor, you’ll need the Teacher Toolbox (if you do not already have it).
Head over to the [Teacher Toolbox](https://education.github.com/toolbox) and fill out the application. You’ll need to provide dated proof that you are a faculty member at your institution, so have that on hand.

Some Teacher Toolbox applications require a manual review, so we highly recommend you apply at the beginning of your training if you plan on becoming a GitHub Campus Advisor. After you have applied, your confirmation page will indicate approximately how long your application review may take.
