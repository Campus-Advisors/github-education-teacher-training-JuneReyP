# Assignment 2: Teacher Toolbox
In order to fully take advantage of GitHub Education teacher benefits, you’ll need the Teacher Toolbox (if you do not already have it).

Head over to the [Teacher Toolbox](https://education.github.com/toolbox) and fill out the application. You’ll need to provide dated proof that you are a faculty member at your institution, so have that on hand.

Some Teacher Toolbox applications require a manual review and may take longer to receive a decision and response. After you have applied, your confirmation page will indicate approximately how long your application review may take.
